# Myntra-Women-Power
   Participated in Unstop Challenge Myntra HackerRamp: WeForShe 2024. Because of our unique ideas we shortlisted for the next phase of the challenge.</br>

USE CASE :  Engagement on a shopping platform </br>
	Building engagement constructs on a platform which will drive a connect and virality among younger audiences in the country. It need not be linked to shopping but needs to be linked to fashion, which will drive users to keep visiting the app on a habitual basis.</br>

SOLUTION :</br>
--> Incorporating a camera feature similar to Snapchat that virtually fits clothes to customers' bodies will create a novel and engaging shopping experience. This unique feature will attract customers, increasing the time they spend on the platform.

--> By giving customers a better sense of how clothes will fit, the virtual fitting feature can help reduce the number of returns due to size and fit issues.

--> Virtual fitting can help customers get a better idea of how clothes will look on them, reducing uncertainty and boosting their confidence in making a purchase.

--> By uploading pictures of each dress in different sizes (S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL), customers can better visualize how clothes will look on their specific body type, leading to more informed purchase decisions.

--> Catering to a wide range of body sizes can attract a more diverse customer base, enhancing the platform's reach and appeal across different demographics.

--> Providing fashion tips tailored to different body features and skin tones helps customers choose clothes that enhance their appearance, making them more satisfied with their purchases.

--> The combination of virtual fitting, inclusive size representation, and personalized fashion tips sets the platform apart from competitors, creating a strong unique selling proposition (USP).

--> These initiatives position the brand as innovative, inclusive, and customer-centric, enhancing its reputation and appeal in the market.
